Me and the guys in the opening act
We hanging around the bar
Drinking some whiskey and playing some pool
You know how it is when you're stars
All those beautiful chicks were hanging around
It is just the same in every town

Kom igne, Sven
Touring is my life, touring is my life
You should have seen me backstage
When I fucked your wife
Touring is my life, touring is my life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

My name is GAIS-Åke Feskebyxa
And I am the star
My name is Snowy and I play the guitar
My name is Niklas
Och jag har... min mage är full med gas
My name is Peter and jag spelar denna bas

Touring is my life, touring is my life
You should have seen me backstage
When I fucked your wife
Touring is my life, touring is my life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Touring is my life, touring is my life
You should have seen me backstage
When I fucked your wife
Touring is my life, touring is my life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

S+ kan det gå, enna, så vettu
