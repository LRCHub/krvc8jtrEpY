Well, we've been to London and we've been to L.A. Spain, New Zealand, and the U.S.A
Europe, Japan, and pango-pango Canada, Siam, OZ and Kamoto

The kids all come from miles around
The party gets started when the sun goes down
A holiday inns the only home I know
I know, I know, I know

And rock-n-rolls alive cause we got the power baby
Cruising down the highway at 500 miles an hour baby

We got a fuel-injected tour bus, man it really flies
With a video tape deck inside

Let's go, rock-n-roll, everybody c'mon
Let's go, rock-n-roll, everybody c'mon now

Touring, touring, is never boring touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring touring, touring, oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl touring, touring, all around the world

Well we've been around this great big world
And we've met all kinds of guys and girls
From Kamoto islands to rockaway beach
No, its not hard, not far to reach

American girls knock me out, ya know
Fast cars, cold beer, and rock-n-roll
America is the only home I know
I know, I know, I know

Let's go let's go let's go let's go 500 miles to Mexico
Let's go let's go let's go let's go 200 miles to Tokyo
Let's go let's go let's go let's go

Drive, drive, drive the night away
Straight on through to the break of day
Drive, drive, drive the night away
Well, its in your blood, its in your blood

Touring, touring, is never boring touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring touring, touring, oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl now
Touring touring, all around the world touring touring, all around the world
Touring touring, all around the world touring touring, all around the world
