Jaycee, tell 'em

We just OT turn,
Switchin' lanes in the night when I swerve from boydem
All these points we scorin',
Bro's man of the match, ten toes and we lurkin'
I got this cutie who's callin',
Put my life on the line, trap house doin' numbers
And free the gang locked up,
Time's keep comin' past, can't wait till they come out
I fell in love with the trap
Pips up to the dots that you missed my landin'
Bad bitch on my dick get it all looked down there
Gotta feed the streets as a view my land there
Bag it up, bag it up, till we all rich

I fell in love with the trap
When I got beef, man, a man can't lack
When he's not bad I'm a jax
Two step, one hand on my pants
I went thru', I got bag in the trap
I was pissed cah I just went call for an awesome shank
Everyone's talking bad
Till my guys jump out gang with enormous shanks and turn a man damp
I done smoked man in the jailhouse like a 1P of burnin' hash
On the real side is a rambo,
Really tryna dig it in and turn man splash, dash
Doin' up scales and bags sell GB in ends but it's always crack
Like a civ won't use giff-gaff,
Feelin' lucky your brick got sams and mash
In the dots in the side of the ride is same
Me and my guys ride on your guys' estate
It's bait that this is our license plate
Been on backroads tryna swerve from baits, skate
We ain't tryna hold no chase from the
Jakes, bro ride like there ain't no brakes
Remember that time when we rid on that
Cash guy, 15 guys and there weren't no space
All these peng ting used to call me bro like
My dick's in the hole and they calling me low
But the same ting givin' me throat, go, choke on the cookie like smoke
Foreign Kremz's supply got taken off road
Like peanut butter and a penguin, sugar and milk I was really on oats

We just OT turn,
Switchin' lanes in the night when I swerve from boydem
All these points we scorin',
Bro's man of the match, ten toes and we lurkin'
I got this cutie who's callin',
Put my life on the line, trap house doin' numbers
And free the gang locked up,
Time's keep comin' past, can't wait till they come out
I fell in love with the trap
Pips up to the dots that you missed my landin'
Bad bitch on my dick get it all looked down there
Gotta feed the streets as a view my land there
Bag it up, bag it up, till we all rich

I'm in the streets all week no collie
Got beef but we gotta feed the streets like Roddy
I'm like, anyting B but goddy
I'm bad so I gotta tell my mumzy sorry (sorry)
I got this bad b givin' me noddy
I just buss on her face and body now she
Lookin' at me like she wan' tek body (hehe)
But I gotta take chill like freeze,
Gotta go get Ps, man, like grains of rice (truss)
I got money on my mind like Nines (I do)
My grind can't stop like time,
Gotta get my re tryna batter this slime (gotta batter it)
I got beef, that's calm, that's fine,
Get right tryna get a man down like spice (splash)
I ain't even tryna get nicked
If I get nicked I'll probably get a long time (fuck dat)
Juggin', I'm juggin' (juggin', I'm juggin')
I need this cake, I need this money, I need this pudding
For my bro I take risks they wouldn't (they wouldn't, they wouldn't)
Let's get it, let's get it
Buy some credit
Put it on the line, buy drugs and sell it
Test out the nine like Giggs and press it
Look, Imma ride out (ride out)
I got niggas tryna turn me to a lifer (to a lifer)
I've been leavin' niggas drippin' like designer (like designer)
We, we be pull up with these bs and let
Them fire, smoke dem man get higher (bow)

We just OT turn,
Switchin' lanes in the night when I swerve from boydem
All these points we scorin',
Bro's man of the match, ten toes and we lurkin'
I got this cutie who's callin',
Put my life on the line, trap house doin' numbers
And free the gang locked up,
Time's keep comin' past, can't wait till they come out
I fell in love with the trap
Pips up to the dots that you missed my landin'
Bad bitch on my dick get it all looked down there
Gotta feed the streets as a view my land there
Bag it up, bag it up, till we all rich
